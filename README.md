# Welcome to the Thrifty mobile app

This app is designed to help manage your items as you thrift for more and more cool items.  There are three pages in the app.

## Want

On this page you can create a list of items you're looking to find, how many you want and even set a budget.  Use this like a long running shopping list where you can easily add and remove items.  You can even sent a text message to a friend to see if they can find an item on your list.

## Purchases

On the purchases page you can look back and see what you've previously purchased.  It's also possible to update the items purchased, delete items you wish you never purchased and add new purchases right from the app.

## Sold

The sold page is a great reference to see what items have been sold and for how much.  You can add items that have been sold by you or even add items sold by others as a point of reference
